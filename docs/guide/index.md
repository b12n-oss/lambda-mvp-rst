# lambda-mvp-jlt, User guide

`lambda-mvp-jlt` runs [Jolt](https://github.com/jolt-lang/jolt) (native Clojure on Chez Scheme, no JVM) on AWS Lambda as a **custom runtime**, the same `provided.al2023` contract that [awslabs/aws-lambda-cpp](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-cpp) implements for C++. The runtime loop itself is about 60 lines of Clojure. On top of it sits a demo handler and a `jolt bench` tool built specifically to answer one question: how much does a Lambda invocation actually cost in wall-clock time, cold versus warm, at different memory tiers, on your own AWS account.

Every AWS-touching command in this repo relies entirely on the caller's own `aws` CLI configuration (`AWS_PROFILE`/`AWS_REGION`, or `aws configure`). Nothing here hardcodes a profile, an account, or a region: clone it, point it at your account, and the same commands that produced this project's own measured numbers will produce yours.

## How to read this guide

**New to the project?** Start with [Getting started](getting-started.md) for the offline probe, the Docker build, and your first live deploy. Then read [Architecture](architecture.md) for how the pieces fit together: the Runtime API loop, the AL2023 build, and the bench tool.

**Want the Runtime API loop's own design notes?** [The Runtime API loop](runtime-api-loop.md) covers the poll/execute/respond contract, why the loop needs no JSON dependency, and the offline mock that makes runtime-loop changes a two-second local iteration.

**Building on Amazon Linux 2023?** [Building on Amazon Linux 2023](al2023-build.md) covers the glibc constraint that forces a from-source build, the recipe itself, and the AL2023 packaging gotchas that cost a build round each.

**Want to understand or reproduce the cold/warm boot-time story?** [Cold vs. warm boot](cold-warm-boot.md) is the reason this project exists: what `jolt bench` measures, how to read the table it prints, and the recipe for reproducing a jolt-version comparison against your own account.

**Contributing a change?** [Contributing](contributing.md) covers the build, the test commands, and this project's conventions.
