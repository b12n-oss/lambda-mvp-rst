  "`jolt demo`: build, deploy and invoke the demo handler in one go. Every
  check that can fail runs first (tools on PATH, AWS credentials and region,
  Docker access, emulation for the target architecture), so a missing piece
  stops the run before a multi-minute build or any change to the AWS account.
  The steps themselves are the ordinary `image`, `deploy` and `invoke` tasks."
